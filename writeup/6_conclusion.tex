\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% Definitions:
% 1. Novel model for conditional lexicographic MDPs.
% 2. Novel algorithm to solve this model based on VI.

% Proofs:
% 1. Formal worst-case bound for slack.
% 2. Completeness by the convergence for a subset of LMDPs which satisfy an assumption. We also explained exactly why this assumption exists.
% 3. Correctness of LMDPs and LVI, in terms of its connection to a normal form game.
% 4. Uniqueness and novelty of the resulting policy as compared to linearly weighted scalarization functions.

% Experimentation:
% 1. Natural use in a novel domain for semi-autonomous systems.
% 2. Addressed scalability issues via GPU-based optimizations.

% Future Work:
% 1. Convergence of LVI in the general case, for which our simulations suggest must exist. Also, since it is related to a Nash equilibrium, it must be a fixed point.
% 2. Detailed discussion of GPU-based optimizations for LVI.
% 3. A complete definition of semi-autonomous systems, and a set of corresponding experiments using LMDPs and LVI.
